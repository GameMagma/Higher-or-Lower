Gameplay (I may be wrong about the role of the AI, but this is my best guess as to the right answer):
- User and AI are dealt 1 card each.
- The AI shows the card to the player and asks if the card the player has is higher or lower
- If the player guesses correctly, they win. If they guess incorrectly, they lose. If the cards are equal values, it's a tie.

Now, the AI might be a second player (as in, one that has the potential of beating you), in which case they would also
have to guess. This would be pretty easy to do though: just have the AI have a turn like the player, then have it guess
a random integer between 1-13 (inclusive).

Internal Process (Using the AI):
1. DeckManager creates and fills deck of cards (Function called in Main/Told to do so by Main)
2. DeckManager deals one card to the player and one card to the AI
3. Player is asked to guess higher or lower, scanner gets input
4. Reveal the AI's card and get values of both cards and compare: If player guessed correctly (i.e. guess was higher,
they had 4 and AI had 1), they win, game over. If not, they lose. Game over.*

Internal Process (Without the AI):
1. DeckManager creates and fills deck of cards (Function called in Main/Told to do so by Main)
2. DeckManager deals one card to the player and one card to a variable in Main
3. Player is asked to guess higher or lower, scanner gets input
4. Get card values of both cards and compare: If player guessed correctly (i.e. guess was higher, they had 4 and Main had 1),
they win, game over*. If not, they lose. Game over.*

* Could do a points system to keep the game going, this is just the most straightforward thing

Difference between these two methods is one uses the AI class, and one pushes the process of the AI class into Main. This
only works if we're assuming the game works how I think it works, which it very well might not.
